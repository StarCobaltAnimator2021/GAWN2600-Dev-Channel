Instructions on enabling the Findings on GAWN2600 build 22567.1:

You need Notepad++ to enable the findings on this build, so here are the list:

Settings on Header.
Apparently Settings on Header are introduced in this build, but it is disabled by default.

To enable it, do these steps:

Step 1: Right-click on footer.eta (Located in wrapper > views > includes) then click Edit with Notepad++ and
erase the lines with <a href="/settings"></a> (Make sure you erase text too)

Step 2: Copy the following text to paste below in header.eta, above "Upload a Movie" text:

<a href="/settings">SETTINGS</a>

and that's it, you now have yourself a Setting button moved to the header.
