About GoAniWayneNathaniel2600
GoAniWayneNathaniel2600 is a Wrapper Offline Clone that has all of it's assets pre-installed with some bonuses
Plus, it had a Different Community which is completely separated from the Regular GoAnimate Community, Which is a deal because
The GoAnimate Community is a full of drama but Having a new Community is better.

Although It was distributed inside of the GoAnimate Community. Still has it's own Community.

GoAniWayneNathaniel2600 is based on Wrapper Offline. this is why you will be seeing some areas saying *Wrapper Offline*, But it's actually different. 

Take note that you can join on GoAnimate and GoAniWayneNathaniel2600 Communities simultaneously without hurting other communities.
